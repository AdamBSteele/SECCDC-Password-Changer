SECCDC-Password-Changer
=======================

This script was written to benefit my team at SECCDC.  
The script iterates through accounts on /etc/password, highlights sensitive accounts, 
and then prompts you to change the password for the account.
It was created so that the team could hop on any fresh VM and reset the most important passwords
as quickly as possible.
